**Pinpoint** is an APM (Application Performance Management) tool for large-scale distributed systems written in Java. Inspired by [Dapper](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html "Google Dapper"), Pinpoint provides a solution to help analyze the overall structure of the system and how components within them are interconnected by tracing transactions across distributed applications.

You should definitely check **Pinpoint** out If you want to

* understand your [application topology](./overview.html) at a glance
* monitor your application in *Real-Time*
* gain code-level visibility to every transaction
* install APM Agents without changing a single line of code
* have minimal impact on the performance (approximately 3% increase in resource usage)
